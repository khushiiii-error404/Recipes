            <li>6 ½ (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, cut into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water.

            <li>Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until pale and thick,
                 about 5 minutes. Mix in melted chocolate, flour, cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt until combined. 
                 Pour batter into the prepared ramekins and place on a baking tray.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sides are set but the middle is still jiggly, 10 to 13 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving</li>
